**🧐 About the Project**

Imagine it is 7 PM, guests are arriving at eight, and your kitchen is a mess. Panic hits. Across town, a skilled woman sits idle, wishing she could earn from her cooking.

RentBee solves this by connecting these two individuals with a single tap. We are not just creating 'gigs'; we are creating 'decent work' and inclusive economic opportunities by formalizing the informal economy.

**⚙️ How It Works**

The platform operates in three simple steps:

Request: Users search for a skill (e.g., "Home Cook," "Math Tutor," "Nanny").

Match: The system displays verified, background-checked providers with ratings and profiles.

Book & Pay: The user books a time and pays securely via the platform.

**🚀 Core Features**
For Customers (The "Requesters")

Intuitive Skill Search: Find providers based on skill, location, and rating.

Verified Profiles: View photos, intro videos, bios, skills, and "RentBee Badges".

Secure In-App Payments: Integrated with Bkash and Nagad. Payments are held in escrow until the job is complete.

In-App Chat: Communicate securely without sharing personal phone numbers.

For Providers (The "Professionals")

Flexible Schedule: Set your own hours and availability.

Public Profile: Showcase skills and build a reputation to earn badges.

Guaranteed Payments: Secure, on-time payments managed by the platform.

Safety Tools: Access to an SOS button and 24/7 support.

**🛡️ Trust & Safety Protocol**

Trust is our foundation. We utilize a 360-degree safety protocol:

Verification: Mandatory National ID (NID) or passport submission for all providers.

RentBee Badges: Visual indicators for "Safety-Verified," "Reliability Rockstar," and "Community Favorite".

SOS Button: A panic button available during service that alerts our support team.

Escrow System: Payments are held securely until the user confirms service completion.

Dispute Resolution: Robust in-app reporting and blocking features.

**💻 Tech Stack**

Frontend: React.js / Next.js, TailwindCSS.

Backend: Node.js (Express) or Django.

Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL.

Authentication: Firebase Auth / JWT.

Payment Gateway: Bkash & Nagad API Integration.

Deployment: Vercel / AWS.

**💰 Business Model**

Service Commission: A transparent 10-15% fee on completed transactions.
