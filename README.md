**🧐 About the Project**

Imagine it is 7 PM, guests are arriving at eight, and your kitchen is a mess. Panic hits. Across town, a skilled woman sits idle, wishing she could earn from her cooking.

RentBee solves this by connecting these two individuals with a single tap. We are not just creating 'gigs'; we are creating 'decent work' and inclusive economic opportunities by formalizing the informal economy.

**⚙️ How It Works**

The platform operates in three simple steps:

Request: Users search for a skill (e.g., "Home Cook," "Math Tutor," "Nanny").

Match: The system displays verified, background-checked providers with ratings and profiles.

Book & Pay: The user books a time and pays securely via the platform.

**🚀 Core Features**

Intuitive Skill Search: Find providers based on skill, location, and rating.
